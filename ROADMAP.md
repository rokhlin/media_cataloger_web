## 📋 Development Plan & Planned Features

### Architecture & Core Infrastructure
- [ ] **Comprehensive Documentation**: Create complete architecture, API, and setup documentation.
- [x] **Feature Development Guidelines**: Create developer guidelines and standards for contributing new features.
- [x] **TypeScript Support**: Migrate/add TypeScript support across the frontend and interface definitions.
- [x] **Modular Architecture & Interface Structuring**: Refactor files, models, and interfaces into clean, structured layers.
- [ ] **Error handling & recovery**: Handle errors gracefully and provide options for recovery. Define rules for:
    - source not available
    - file not exist / deleted
    - transcription error
    - face recognition error
    - LLM API error (Gemini, LM Studio)
    - image analysis error
    - db error
- [x] **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration test suites covering Kinship, Family Tree, Settings, Config, Thumbnails, i18n, Themes, and Cache.
- [x] **Docker / Host Decoupling**: Separate application core dependencies from local host environment for robust Docker deployment.
- [x] **Caching strategies: controls section**: Rename `Execution controls` tab insettings to `File metadata operations`. Change UI accordingly. Add `Caching strategy` section to control cache
- [x] **Cahcing strategies**: Review current caching strategies and implement more efficient caching where needed. Main requirement to increase the system performance and reduce the response time of the application:
    -  Media library mostly is static and doesnt have a lot of realtime changes. So we should keep fast caching, allow to user trigger a mannual caching for the specific folder or for all. 
    - Define Daily caching automation: for the mediafiles added on a last time. Store last cached datetime, schedule the next recache. and do it onl for the new/changed that time files.
    - Add controls to run caching manually in `Caching strategy` section.
- [x] **Caching strategies: on duplicates removing**: after remove duplicates, recalculate the cache for the remaining files.
- [x] **Caching strategies: on folder remove**: after remove folder, recalculate the cache for the remaining files. It's also make sense for the folders rename operation.


### Metadata, Processing & AI Pipeline
- [ ] **Transcription Integration**: Fully embed audio transcription into the main media analysis pipeline.
- [x] **Media Tagging System**: Support custom and person tagging for media assets with sidecar synchronization.
- [x] **Metadata Editing**: Add full support for viewing and editing metadata.
- [ ] **Write Analysis to File Metadata**: Option to embed analysis results directly back into media files (EXIF/XMP/ID3). Disabled by default. This feature should be configurable in the admin panel.
- [x] **In-Viewer Metadata Editor**: Direct inline metadata editing within the preview modal/window.
- [ ] **AI Analysis Agent**: Dedicated autonomous AI agent for deep file analysis and insights.
- [ ] **Face Optimization Service**: Background service for periodic face embedding optimization and clustering.
- [ ] **Semantic Search**: Vector-based semantic search across media content, transcripts, and metadata.
- [x] **Worker Queue**: Configure a queue of media files for analysis with parallel processing capabilities.

### Grouping by Similarity
- [x] **Similar files or series Grouping**: Group similar files or series of files based on similarity threshold. Similar files should be grouped together Show only one file from each group and a badge indicating the number of similar files. Allow user to see all files in a group in viewer. Keep analysis logic in `media_cataloger` as much as possible. File management put in `media_cataloger_web`. 
- [x] **Advanced Duplicate Grouping**: Enhanced UI and pipeline for managing duplicate and burst photos. Duplicate finding should be a dedicated feature that allow used to clean up duplicates. Allow to process duplicates in background. After search is done, show summary of duplicates found. User should be able to review duplicates and decide which ones to keep and which ones to delete. User should be able to delete duplicates. Allow to find duplicates in chuncks of folders. Split duplicate definition (similarity threshold, grouping logic) from ai analysis results. Add configuration for duplicate definition in admin panel. Users can use it to define their own duplicate detection logic. Show duplicates in group view with one selected file and list of other files in the group. Allow user to compare selected file with other files in the group. Allow user to select files to delete. Allow to move files to another folder.Keep analysis logic in `media_cataloger` as much as possible. File management put in `media_cataloger_web`. Search duplicates by similarity threshold (user defined) is one use case. Find exact duplicates is another use case. Find files that are identical in content but with different file names or extention type or file size.

Add the feature flag show list if flag is active and as buttons if flag is not active. Dropdown menu should be at the same line with `Filter, Sort and Search Bar` dropdown
- [x] **UI refactoring** Refactor the UI. Put all screens in a dedicated folder `screens`. Keep under components UI components groupped by features. Create `common` folder for common UI components. 
    Example: 
    - `Header component` in `components/header` folder, All nested components like header-settings, header-theme, header-profile, etc should be in `components/header` folder.
    -  in `components/common` create generic component `button` to cover all buttons with the same style like button With Icon and text.
    -  in `components/common` create generic component `toggle` to cover all toggles with the same style.
    -  in `components/common` create generic component `image-view` to cover all image views.
    -  in `components/common` create generic component `modal-container` to cover all modal containers.
    - Make sure that all components are split by features and are self-contained.
    - Avoid circular dependencies. Use hooks to share logic between components. 
Do the same for all components. Do not change functionality. Add tests.
- [x] **Refactoring: Buttons** :
      Buttons: 
        -  All buttons should have `id` also if it not in use
        -  Use common button component if it possible to keep one single styling in the whole project. Create the new common button component if wasnt exist.
        -  Create rule to use common components for: buttons, toggles, modals, etc.
        - Export Styles from Component tree. create a hook that by name provides the specific style.
- [x] **Feature flags for buttons** : Add in feature flags the functionality to toggle on/off buttons by Id. Add under `CSS Class Names (Optional)` in `Create Feature flag`
the same input for button id's. It also should be ooptional. User can add buttonIds or clas name or together to toggle feature on/off.

The relationship can be defined between two families. In person card if the person has spounse need to add an ability to view and edit spounse ditails: add start and end date if divorced. For relationship you cannot add person to the tree but you can add the name of the person.
- [x] **Live facts: Configuration**: Add to Tree settings a configuration for Live facts. User should be able to define the following: 
    1. What to show in Person Life facts: All own facts, Farts of close relatives (Parents, Siblings, Children, Grandparents, etc), configure in a checkbox style.
    2. Also which facts to include: Not applicable like a relationship of other peopele. I need to be able to define it in the settings.
